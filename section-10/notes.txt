terminal multiplexer like Screen or Tmax
:beffers to display the list of buffers
you can use :ls as well
:buffer 2 (or :b2)
:b buf-dad.txt
you can move to the next buffer using :bnext or bn
similar for previous using :bprevious or :bp
:bf to go to the first buffer
similar for :bl to go to the last buffer
to go to the previously opened buffer cntr ^
%a means the buffer is loaded in the window, % means it is the buffer in the current window and the a means it is an active buffer which means it is loaded and visible
# represents the alternate buffer which you were previously editing
so another way to switch to the alternate buffer is b#
+ means changes happened but not saved yet
h means a hidden buffer
a buffer is in 1 of 3 states:
    active: loaded in memory and displayed in winodw
    hidden: loaded in memory and not displayed in a window
    inactive: not loaded in memory and not being displayed
buffers that don't have any indicators are actually not loaded into memory    

:set hidden will allow you to edit multiple files at once without saving or forcing the switching with !
    buffer will stay in memory once they get loaded
to abandon all changes in all buffers use qall!
to save them all use :wall
to open another file without switching to it immediately use :badd (:badd modes.txt)
:bd to delete a buffer (:bd 3)
:%bd to delete all buffers
:bufdo set nu (bufdo will apply commands to all buffers)
:bufdo %s/#/@/g | w

:E (for explore) you get a file explorer window
use :bd to delete the current buffer if you wanted to exit

you can use :ls or :files or :buffer commands

to split windows horizontally :sp
you can also use cntr w s
vsplit to view buffers side by side
you can also use cntr w v

you can use cntr w q to close the window

to close all windows except the 1 you are in use :on or :only command
or cntr w o

to navigate between windows either use cntr w cntr w, you can also use cntr w j to go to the window below for example
cntr w + to increase height of a window
cntr w > to increase width
similarly for decreasing using - and <
to maximize height of a window use cntr w _
and cntr w |
cntr w = to make all windows of equal size

to rotate windows location cntr w r or cntr w R to rotate in the opposite direction
cntr w J will move the current window to the very bottom to take the full width of the screen
similarly for HIKL
:ba or :ball to open all buffers in your buffer list
:windo is similar to bufdo but only for open windows

:h ^ww to view help on cntr w w

beaware that there might be a couple gotchas when using the cntr cntr version of some commands
if cntr w cntr s didn't work then use cntr q to resume screen updating
likewise cntr w cntr q may not work because some terminal intercept that control
